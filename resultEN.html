    <h1 class="mainTitle">main principles of the modified DISC analysis</h1>
    <section id="prin">
        <div style="background-color: transparent;color:black;" id="prin1">
            <h1>There's no better style.</h1>
            <span>The best style is what suits the position (and we have explained what positions are best for each style). So there is no better style, and there is no so-called better leader in general (this has been confirmed by DISC research).</span>
        </div>
        <div id="prin2">
            <h1>Style should be changed according to the subordinate and the situation</h1>
            <span>An effective leader is the one who is shaped by the style that suits the subordinate and position. he is always based on credibility and honesty, in the interest of the work and of the subordinate.</span>
        </div>
        <div id="prin3" >
            <h1>Style forms</h1>
            <span>The pattern forms with age, job quality and work, so you find the accountant taking the pattern d, while the police chief takes the pattern a with the days and changes his style depending on the situation and the people around him.</span>
        </div>
        <div id="prin4">
            <h1>There is an authentic style for each leader</h1>
            <span>Although the leader is required to form and change his style depending on the position; However, this formation or change is cumbersome and can be practiced only in the short term, while in the long term the leader exercises his or her authentic style(where he or she does not need representation).</span>
        </div>
        <div id="prin5">
            <h1>Most people have mixed style</h1>
            <span>15% of people only have one style. While 85% of people have a different percentage of the four styles (this is what we have shown in detailed or mixed styles).</span>
        </div>
        <div id="prin6">
            <h1>Don't be vacillating.</h1>
            <span>The vacillate is the one that uses two contradictory patterns such as (a and c) simultaneously, which is ineffective.If the situation requires firmness, be so, and do not hesitate because of humanitarian aspects (which will undoubtedly appear in crises or pressures).</span>
        </div>

    <h1 class="mainTitle">Key Notes on DISC</h1>
    <section id="notes">
        <div>It is an excellent analysis of leadership styles that have been applied and modified for more than 300 thousand people.</div>
        <div>There is no 100% accurate personality analysis and this analysis is considered to be one of the few excellent where its accuracy ratio is equal to 89 to 91%.</div>
        <div>If you are complaining about the result and the extent to which it applies to your personality, you know yourself better than this analysis (especially since it has an error ratio).</div>
        <div>DISC is affected by your psychological state when it is resolved, and the analysis differs from the work environment to the environment of friends or home (it may be dominant at work while at home it is controlled).</div>
        <div>DISC can be reassessed on the self, but it is preferable that the period between every two tests should not be less than 6 months, the better result and the obvious change will normally not appear before 3 years have passed.</div>
        <div> One analysis of the personality is not enough because each has an error ratio, and therefore it is preferable to try more than one analysis in addition to the DISC.</div>

The best leaders in general are (a b) or (b a) or "persuasive" of the types of Influential or balanced of dominant.</span>
